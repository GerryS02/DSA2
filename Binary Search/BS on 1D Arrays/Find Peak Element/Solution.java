// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the 
// array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always 
// considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
